Name of course: Statistics for machine learning
Certificate provider: greatlearning
The total course is about getting familiar with the statistics jargon and we address the need for statistical tools and techniques. 
Today I went through the session where Hypothesis testing was explained. 
Here the different distributions, formulations and theorems based on hypothesis was taught and how this could be implemented for machine learning.
