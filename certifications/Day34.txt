Name of course: Statistics for machine learning
Certificate provider: greatlearning
The total course is about getting familiar with the statistics jargon and we address the need for statistical tools and techniques. 
Today I went through the session where probability and different probability distributions were taught. 
What are the different types and how can they be implemented were all taught here.
