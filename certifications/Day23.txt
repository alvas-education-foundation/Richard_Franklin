Name of course: Machine learning foundations
Certificate provider: greatlearning
The total course was about the basics and the necessary prerequisites for machine learning. 
I went through the remaining sections of the course which was about linear regression and logistic regression. 
I also had few tests to take as I was advancing through the course.
